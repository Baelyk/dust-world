The weather is always the same. Always the same dusty wind. Not quite a storm, but still not simply dust in the air. The wind doesn't howl; it should; but it doesn't. It is always silent here. No wind, no steps. The only thing to be heard is the shifting of the sands behind you. Never when you are looking, but even if you turn, then the new behind you moves.

The contrast of the sound is eerie. Silence in everything, it doesn't matter how fast I move, but the sands, the shifting sands, those make noise. Me body and the sands. My heart pumping, my breath moving through my throat, swallowing. The sands, the shifting sands.

I search for one place that I can hear the sound of. One place against the monoscape I have to deal with every. I bet there is even a place that doesn't have sands, no sands to shift. But walking in a straight line is hard. But if I walk enough, I should get there. Soon. Eventually. It's not like I have been here long anyway, so why do I care? Why do I care?
