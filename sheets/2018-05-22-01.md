The dust is a nice companion in this world, if you learn to accept it. It is always there, it never leaves you. It is not just in your heart, or your soul, or your hope, but also it is physically present too. Don't think it is going anywhere. Don't think you are either.

What can the meaning of life be an a world without life? What can life be in a world without death? Is death looming? Or not here at all?

Is there anything there if I am not here to see? There must be. In fact, it could be true that there is only anything there if I am not here to see. It moves, I hear, it moves behind, shifting and winding. The dunes are not tall nor shallow, but just. As just as life can be in a world free of civilization, and thus concepts like justice or morality. Imagination is what allows life to continue, the only way of knowing that knows anything at this point. My senses are static, unchanging. The dust and the sand and the winding defy reason. My intuition diverges into seconds and years. My emotions are long since gone, absorbed into the dust, turned into the sand.
