When I think about the things that define my life I can't remember them. Something made me who I am. Something made the choices that I chose. Something brought me where I am. But what? I think and think and think. I despair, for what is a person without the choice and reasons and thoughts that brought the person into their current situation. I have been among the dusts. A duration is unnecessary, because any outside duration does not exist. I will spend the rest of my life here, but it isn't really a life because although I think, thinking doesn't ever do for me. 

At one point I had hope. At one point I had memories. At one point I had life. At one point I was.

Now I am naught.

I am not dust, I am not sand, not yet, at least. I am not this world, I am not sand, not yet, at least. I am nothing, I have nothing, I will be nothing. I will not became part of this world. I will become this world.

I have become this world.
