The dust is the world, the dust is the wind, the dust is the day, the dust is the night, the dust is, if I am not careful, me. The dust is. That is the only sense that can be had in this world. There is nothing without. No dune, ground, no air, no mount. All dust;

I am no longer not sure. I am sure. I need not know time, past or future. Time is dust, and so is my past or so is my future. Hours are dust, seconds are dust, days and years are dust, that is why the feel the same. I have been here seconds, I have been here days, I have been here years: I have been here. I have been here dust.

Was I always this way? Able to brush the pain off my body. Able to brush the feeling off my body. Able to brush my body off my dust. I think that this is the way everything must be. Everything must have always have been this way. I can't—I don't—want to know anything else.
