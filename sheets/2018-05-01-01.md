The dust takes up a lot in the grand scheme of things. It takes everything that I know, it is everything that I know at this point, and I don't know if it is possible that that could ever change. I guess we will discover that soon. But, really not that soon. 

Occassionally there is a dune, there is something, other than the snaking behind, other than the shifting of sands, but hardly ever. Everything stings in this land, if land it could be called.

We walk, we wander, hoping to know, hoping to remember, hoping that the minutes end, while the whole time some part, some part of us knows, some part of us knows that it is false, we haven't been here minutes, we haven't been here years, we have always been, here. The sands don't let you know, they don't want you to, it doesn't want you to. 

**Rule 2: Time is nought but grime**

Time stays, you think, but it lies, it lies on you like the dust and sweat on your skin. You can never really know how long anything has been, or when. When doesn't matter, because when doesn't happen. It seems as if nothing really ever changes, and that doesn't surprise me, for I feel like nothing really does change.

It might be the sameness, the everlasting something that becomes as every as nothing.
