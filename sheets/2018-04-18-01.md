The world is dust and dust and dust. There are likely no dust mites here though. I am not sure if that is a good thing, because along with the lack of dustmites, there is a lack of much other life. That is, at least, traditional forms of life. But that's okay, because as we progress so do our traditions, and eventually they mean as very little to us as the amount of us left.
