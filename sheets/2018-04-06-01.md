It moves, the surface. Clearly something is there. But it doesn't move when you are looking. In that sense, it is a Weeping Angel. But, in most of the other senses, it is not. Especially the "weeping" or "angel" senses... you would be hard pressed to describe the desert as angelic. It twists and turns, it moves in and out, like waves. It does not see you, it cannot look at you, but it knows you, it knows where you are. You attract it, but that is not something you want to do. I must recommend not attracting it. But, you can't. 

The sky is musky, and ground is desert, but the light is bright. The light is intense, the light is bright. Everything seems hued towards orange, you must admire that color. White and orange and grey, but never gray. It isn't as anything to shale. There must be more, there must color, out there some where. But how can you look? The sky isn't blue, even if I wished. You can hardly see far, and even what you do see is not but desert and light. Why is it so bright? The day is very long, does the night come at all? The dark would be such at gift at this time, you wouldn't see the surface move, you would only imagine. I'm sure that's better.

What as that? Did it move? I didn't feel any wind... Come to think of it, I haven't felt any wind. How can there not be wind, in a desert as so, flat and open with waves all abound. Is that a snake? Down in that ground? I dare not dig, the desert unnerves.
