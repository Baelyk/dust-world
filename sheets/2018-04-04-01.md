A planet that is a desert, except that the desert isn’t made of sand. The desert is made up of tiny creatures, except those aren’t really creatures either. They are tiny machines. There mostly dead now. Or, more realistically, asleep now. Or so it seems. It turns out that it is just the surface that is dead. Underneath if very much alive. If you can consider something made up of components that are not alive to be alive (which you should (e.g. cells). But still, it probably isn’t alive in any sort of typical sense. The only reason it seems alive is emergence. It may communicate like it is alive, but it has just learned to do that. Like the Chinese Room. It is not alive, it has just learned what to say based off of what it wants in response to things it receives. Again, that may be like us, but not on the inside. It is very different on the inside. They can’t move through the air, so they move through the ground. Something about the atmosphere kills that quickly, so the surface is always dead. But not the Underneath. The Underneath is alive. It moves, the surface.
