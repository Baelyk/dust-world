I wasn't born here, but I only have memories of here. I don't know why I know I wasn't born here. I guess it is just because the place isn't alien enough. If I was born here, it would be my home. This place, this sandy place, this place is not my home. Regardless of what you may think, reglardless of how long I have been here, this place is not my home. I do not know enough of this to call it my home. I wonder if there is some base amount of information that is necessary to call some place a home, and since I am only ever exposed to a very small, minimal amount of information. Always the same. Enough to get used to it, but not enough to know anything about where I am.

I have never realized that I have gotten used it. But I have. I wonder when that happened. How long it took. In truth, I have been here seconds. Maybe minutes if I am lucky, but I feel as if I have lived my whole entire life here. The Sands of Madness.

Thats where I am thats where I will be, forever. Alone, without a soul to keep mine company. The sands may be alive but they are far from having a soul. The planet does not have a soul, the planet is the sands
