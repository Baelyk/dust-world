The desert is mostly machine, but could it possibly be entirely machine? Likely not. There must be some dust present, some sand. The waste from past visitors, produced and unused. 

I wonder what the seasons must be like, if truly there are any at all. I would think not. I have a feeling that one side is eternally in the light, one side isn't eternally. Could there though be something on the edges? On the borders between the realms? The borderlands? The bridgelands?

There if anywhere should be the most habitable I would think. I shall head for there perhaps. The desert will confuse, but I have the rest of time ahead of me. I should get there eventually, no matter how much it resists. It will be hard though, the desert is not stupid, it is not a random maze. It learns, it acts, individual and together. It's hopeless isn't it?

You would never last long, but that is in the desert. There must be something that exists, but you would never there make it. Again, nothing is clear. The desert is all in all, it seems. But Rule 1, shows that it cannot. What is there in the dark?

The Dark is a land of cold and bitter, the first and metaphorical and the second literal. The light is not bright, but there is a warmth present. Generated only by creatures, small at first, but growing.
