# dust-world / sheets

Sheets is the directory where I will be adding raw and unrefined content that may or may not be cannon. Essentially, I want it to be as easy as possible for me to add if I want to.

## Naming

Files are named like so: `yyyy-mm-dd-nn/md` where `nn` is a hexadecimal number refering to the number of the sheet in case multiple are added in a day.

`nn` starts at `01` to preserve `00` for other use, possibly for a table of contents or description for the sheets uploaded that day.

A sheet is not necessarily named with the day it was last edited, just the day it was created.
