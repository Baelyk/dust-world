Isolation. That is what I feel here. So separated from everything that was once. It is not something that I am used to feeling, or ever honestly expected to feel. I'm not sure how I am still alive, but here I am. I have been here mere minutes but years. So much time but so little experience.

So much is unchanging, but too much is changing. The sands move, the air is dust, the light is bright. That is how I know I have been here for minutes. The light is bright. Never anything else. But sometimes, it feels like years. Sometimes it is years. But I trust the light, and the light is bright. It has always been bright, though.

I tried just sitting, just waiting, just dying. But it hasn't been enough. I can only handle it for a bit, the desert stings. It feels as if I sit for years, but I lie for seconds. I get up, I move, but nothing is always nothing.
