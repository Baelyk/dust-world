I have said that clearly something is there. I was wrong. Nothing here is clear, the sky is musty and the light is much too bright. There must be a point at which bright becomes blight, and I think I can see that point in the distance back where. I say I think, because to return to before, nothing here is clear. 

**Rule 1: Nothing here is clear.**

There it goes, that's what I have put. It must be nice to remember, to be a part, to be a member. I wish that it could be more, I wish that it would speak.

Imagine that planet, the desert, the machines. What are they doing? Why are they there? Are they? Maybe it is a dellusion, told by those who return, but then it would be a dellusion never known. 

Sometimes, the machines move with purpose. The desert moves with purpose, that surface. There must be many, but how many? They move and move but to be the surface is to be dead. The desert sheds surface like no skin sheds cells. What are those structures it makes, as there is no wind, we know their made. Those dunes have an origin, even the small. Where are the foot prints? The crashes... The appear but the do not stay for long, on the surface at least. I think others have been here before but it is so hard to know.
