# Dust
**The desert isn't made of sand...**

**Dust** is the provisional name for the world that I am [building](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/)! The working premise is that the world is covered in a desert made of tiny machines, which die upon contact with the surface. To first looks, that world may seem barren and dead, but the Underneath is very much alive.

Also, I might had an organic counterpart too. I'm not sure. Too, maybe survivors?
